- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gencabreraa,

I'm a results-driven Data Analyst with over 5 years of experience.

Equipped with a Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I am passionate about collaborating with organizations aiming to leverage their data effectively; 
from conceptualizing initial ideas on what to measure and how to accurately capture data, to data preparation, analysis, and management, and finally to delivering 
impactful insights.

I can assist in every phase of the process to empower your organization to make evidence-driven decisions or effectively communicate insights to diverse audiences.
